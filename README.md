# Minecraft-File-Storage
A Python script for storing files as a series of blocks in Minecraft.

Converts input into a series of bytes, then uses a lookup table to convert those bytes into Minecraft blocks.

These blocks can then be added into a world with the Amulet library, allowing for the file to be effectively stored in Minecraft.

Idea from BK Binary's video: ["Storing Files in Minecraft | Project Showcase 3"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z16rzIF5J40)
